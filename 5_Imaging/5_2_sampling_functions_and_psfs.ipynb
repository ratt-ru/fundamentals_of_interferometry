    "For a moment let us discuss radio interferometry and the sky. We can think of the sky as being a 'continuous' image. What I mean by 'continuous' here is that the sky is spatial continuous, as opposed to a digital image which consists of spatially discrete pixels. The Fourier transform of a continuous function is another continous function. Thus, there is some continuous function in the visibility domain which is the Fourier transform of the continuous sky. As a hint of what is to come, we will see that an interferometric array measures, i.e. samples, the continuous visibility domain function. These measurements, colloquially called *visibilities*, can be used to reconstruct, at least partially, an image of the sky. The process of this reconstruction will be presented throughout this chapter. With that motivation let us return to the discussion at hand.\n",

    "At the end of Section 5.1 we saw how the random sampling of the spatial frequency (visibility) domain reconstructs the original image to varying degrees of quality dependent on the number of samples used. Even without complete information, much of the original image can be recovered. In this section we will expand on that idea to show how different samplings of the visibility space will result in different characteristics in the image domain."

The resulting PSF can be seen to have sidelobes that dim but periodically brighten in radius. The observed image has a duck-like shape but is different from the first observed image we produced when the sampling function was a complete circle out to a radius of 20 pixels. We have dropped the inner 5 pixel radius visibility samples. The sum of the observed image is effectively zero, this is because the inner components represent the large scale structure of the image. For example, the sample at $(0,0)$ in the spatial frequency domain is often called the DC component (this comes from 'direct current' in signal processing) and represents the average of the image. By not sampling that component, the remaining image visibility components, when summed should be approximately zero."

A square sampling function results in a strong primary lobe but underlying, repeated sidelobe structures. The cross sampling limits the samples to two orientations but at different spatial frequency scales, which results a strong cross pattern and high sidelobes. A collection of small circles at different positions results in a similar Airy disc of a single circle seen earlier. A Gaussian sampling function, which we will return to later in the chapter, has the nice feature that it's Fourier transform is another Gaussian.

    "From these various examples it should be clear that the choice of sampling greatly affects the resulting image. Ideally the sampling function completely covers the visibility domain, but that is never possible. First, the domain is infinite in extent, that is, by building a large telescope the resolution of the resulting image increases, this can go on *ad infinitum*. There is some practical engineering limit or scientific case to set the maximum resolution of an instrument. The second issue, which we have been hiding away in our examples is that we have assumed the sampling function is on a grid already. The array of pixels which make up the images are regularly spaced and all of the same size (i.e. the sample point covers the area of a pixel). In reality of course, telescope sampling functions are not made up of a grid of pixels, they are continuous. The sampling function must be transformed to a be placed on a regular array by some approximate interpolation method called *gridding* (along with an inverse method *degridding*). This will be covered in more detail in the next section. As we will see in interferometry, an assembly of baseline tracks will lead to complex sampling functions dependent on a number of factors such as array layout, oberserving frequency, sky direction, and integration time."

The lowest frequency of the observation is represented by the red side of the track, and the highest frequency is the blue side. As can be seen, some tracks overlap in regions of the visibility space. These regions are being sampled multiple times during and observation, the issue of how to deal with this multi-sampling will come up latter in the chapter when we discuss weighting schemes. There are also empty regions of the sampling space, and one might talk about the 'holes in the uv coverage'. Notably is the central hole in the coverage, if the auto-correlations were included in an observation, this is the location in visibility space where these samples would be placed.

Unlike most other telescopes interferometric arrays have a declination dependent PSF. The short reason for the declination dependence is that the array is distributed in 3-D space, usually on the surface of the Earth, and the baselines are projected onto a 2-D surface. Depending on the pointing direction the 2-D projection will result in different baseline tracks. This is one of the great advantages of interferometric arrays, as the Earth rotates the baseline tracks are drawn out to fill in regions of the visibility space. But, it adds a complication to observations as the PSF changes with every observation.\n",

    "It is worth bringing up the idea of the 'ideal' sampling function and resulting PSF for a moment. Obviously the ideal sampling function would sample all spatial frequencies out to infinite resolution. But, of course this is not realistic, instrumentational limits do not make this possible, and the resulting amount of data would be infinite. This is a bit of a strawman arguement, a more realistic ideal PSF would be to fully sample all spatial frequencies out to Nyquist frequency based on the desired resolution. Effectively this would be an Airy disc sampling function. But, the sharp edge of the Airy function results in strong PSF sidelobes. If instead, a Gaussian is used, this has a nice feature in which the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian. The scale of this Gaussian is with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) on the scale of the Airy disc. This idea will arise again when the restored image is introduced in the deconvolution chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now we have been creating sampling functions by selecting pixels in an image, that is, we have been picking sampling fuctions which are on a regular grid. But, in interferometry the baselines are (almost) never on a grid, the individual baseline tracks are sampled at a given time and not a given position, this leads to a irregular sampling of the visibility domain. An image can be constructed out of these non-uniformly placed samples with a standard Fourier Transform, but that is a computationally slow method. If the samples are on a grid, a fast Fourier Transform method can be used, which greatly decreases the computational load. In order to take advantage of this improvement a 'gridding' step is performed on the visibility samples. This is covered in the next section along with its complimentary process of degridding which is used required for many modern deconvolution methods."
