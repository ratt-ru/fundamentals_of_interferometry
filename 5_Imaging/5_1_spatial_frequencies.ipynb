Before we dive into specifics of radio interferometric imaging using aperture synthesis, we will cover the ideas which relate the spatial domain (i.e. an image) to the spatial frequency domain (i.e. the visibilities). To do this we will start with the Fourier transform which is the mathematics that relate the two domains. Using that framework we will transform simple signals between the two domains to understand how the a signal in one domain appears in the other. This is the groundwork we need to understand before we can start constructing sky images from the observed visibilities of an interferometric array."

A useful idea is that the sky is made up of mostly 'point source' objects which one might call stars or galaxies or blobs. Whatever these are, they are 'unresolved' sources or *delta functions*. Equation [above &#10549;](#eq:dft2_VI) states that a delta function in an image is a complex sinusoidal wave in the visibility domain and vica-versa. This means that one does not need to fully sample the visibility space to detect a point source in the image domain. Put in other words, this is an issue a signal being sparse in one domain (image) and dense in another domain (visibility). It is to our advantage to make a measurement in a domain where the signal is spread through-out the space and then transform the observed signal into a more preferable (but sparser) domain.\n",

In the next section we will look at some simple examples which hopefully provide some insight into this domain. A useful metaphor here is to that of painting an image with a number different-sized paint brushes at different stroke angles. The painting is the spatial-domain image, and one can think of a point in the spatial-frequency domain as representing the amount of paint (in our case, a complex power) applied using a specific brush size at a specific stroke angle. In the spatial frequency domain, all points at the same radius represent the same sized paint brush but at all possible stroke angles. And, points further out represent smaller paint brushes (that is the brushes which can do fine details) compared to points closer to the centre which are for the large structures such as flat backgrounds. Additionally, not as much stroke angle control is required for the large paint brushes compared to the smaller brushes, so only a few points are need in the spatial frequency domain to fully represent a large brush.\n",

    "As it turns out, using only the amplitude information results in an almost empty image with some power spread over the centre of the image. Taking the logarithm of the image results in something similar to the amplitude figure of the Fourier transformed image shown earlier in the section. A way to think about the phase and amplitude information is that phase information describes the structure of an image, that is, where the power needs to be placed. And ampltiude information describes the intensity of that structure given a position. The constructive and destructive interference of all the sinusoidal waves leads to a reconstruction of the image. If the amplitudes of all the sinusoidal waves is unity then there is still interference between the waves leading to a partial image. But, if that phase information is gone then there will be no interference and there will only be noise in the reconstructed image.\n",

When the image is Fourier transformed the resulting signal is now 'twice' the information because it is complex (there is a real and imaginary component at each point) but no new information has been created as it is a linear transform. The Fourier transformed signal is redundant along a diagonal axis, each value above the diagonal has an equivalent (conjugated) value below the diagonal. Now if only the real-component is used to inverse Fourier transform back to the spatial domain then this results in an image which is the sum of the original image and a $180^{\\circ}$ rotated image, this is an addition because conjugation does not effect the sign of the real components. The imaginary-component image is the difference image of the original and a $180^{\\circ}$ rotated image because the conjugation flips the imaginary sign."

That is, the information has been spread out over every pixel, in the spatial frequency domain the point source signal is now dense. This comes about because a true point-source, i.e. a delta function, can only be reconstructed by an infinite set of complex sinusoidal waves.

    "In the final image we can see the visibility space is not fully sampled, but since the majority of positions are sampled it is difficult to see any difference in the resulting image compared to the original. This is an important point, we don't need to sample all the spatial frequency modes to reconstruct an image that is very similar to the original. And, this point leads us into the next section where we are faced with physical limits on the instruments we can build and how we construct images from interferometric visibilities."
