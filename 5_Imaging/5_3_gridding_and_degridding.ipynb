    "In the previous section several sampling functions were presented. There the sampling functions were already neatly discretized and displayed as images. Each image was a grid of pixels (all with the same size). Fourier inverting such regularly sampled data is done with a fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. This is called the \"fast\" Fourier Transform because it is computationally more efficient that the Direct Fourier Transform (DFT). To give an idea of how fast this algorithm is, if there are $N^2$ pixels in the image, the FFT takes roughly $2N^2\\log(N)$ computational operations. In contrast, the complexity of the DFT also depends on the number of visibilities $M$ and takes $N^2M$ steps. Here $M\\approx N^2$ and for each pixel we must take $M$ complex exponentiations and multiplications. Specifically, the DFT calculates the intensity of each pixel:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " I(l,m) = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}V_k(u,v)e^{2\\pi i (lu+mv)}\\text{, }V_k\\text{ are the M measurements taken by the telescope}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "From this it should be clear that as the number of baselines or observation time is increased, the FFT approach would be far less time-consuming than the the direct approach. Unfortunately radio interferometers don't take measurements at regular intervals, and thus an FFT cannot be used on the observation data directly. Instead the data has to be *resampled* onto a grid with points spaced at regular intervals before taking the FFT. This resampling process (called *gridding*) and its inverse (called *degridding*) is the topic of this section. The big idea here is that we do gridding and degridding because it enables us to create an image faster than if we did the DFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see later some u,v space image deconvolution algorithms such as the Cotton-Schwab ➞ major-minor cycle algorithm require that sources in image space are reconverted back into the non-regular measurement space. Here an accurate degridding operation is required to \"interpolate\" regularly sampled visibilities back onto the u,v tracks shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the issue of resampling when using the FFT transform approach, is the issue of *aliasing*. The FFT assumes that the input signal (here the spatial frequency domain) is periodic in nature. The resultant image constructed by resampling and inverse FFT therefore repeats at regular intervals: sources near the top of the image are aliased back into the image at the bottom for instance. This introduces the necessity to filter the image with a filter that only passes signal that falls within the field of view being reconstructed. Aliasing is an effect of Nyquist sampling ([$\\S$ 2.9 &#10142;](../2_Mathematical_Groundwork/2_9_sampling_theory.ipynb)) the visibilities based on the grid size. An example of this form of aliasing will be given later on.\n",

    "When generating an image from visibilities, using either a direct or fast Fourier transform, two parameters need to be defined: the resolution of each pixel and the extent of the image either as the number of pixels or as the size of the field of view (depending on the particular imager). An image will be a two-dimensional array of size $N_l \\times N_m$ and each pixel will have a resolution of $(\\Delta \\theta_l, \\Delta \\theta_m)$ if we are making the small angle approximation for the field of view. Recall that the image size is $l' = \\cos{\\theta_l}$, $m' = \\cos{\\theta_m}$, the resolution is $\\Delta l = \\cos{\\Delta \\theta_l}$, $\\Delta m = \\cos{\\Delta \\theta_m}$ and in the small angle approximation $\\Delta l \\sim \\Delta \\theta_l$, $\\Delta m \\sim \\Delta \\theta_m$. Though, many imagers can create images which break the small angle approximation the notation is retained. There are a number of techniques for representing a point in spherical coordinates, via a non-linear transform, on a two-dimensional plane. In radio interferometry the standard technique is SIN-projection, see [<cite data-cite='Greisen1994'>AIPS Memo 27</cite> &#10548;](ftp://ftp.aoc.nrao.edu/pub/software/aips/TEXT/PUBL/AIPSMEMO27.PS) for a detailed discussion of different coordinate projections.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$N_m = \\frac{\\theta_m}{\\Delta \\theta_m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the uv tracks samples spatial frequency, so therefore the chosen image resolution (cell size) must satisfy the Nyquist relation. For a given interferometer resolution and image size the image domain resolution/grid size $(\\Delta \\theta_l, \\Delta \\theta_m)$ is\n",

    "\n",
    "And the number of pixels is unchanged $N_u = N_l$, $N_v = N_m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important note about the number of pixels is that one should try to use values which are powers of 2, i.e. $N_l = 2^j$, $N_m = 2^k, $ for some positive $j,k$. This is because of how FFT's are implemented, the optimal run-time efficiency of an FFT is with input lengths which are powers of 2 and are least efficient when the input length is a prime number. For example, the time required to generate a 256 by 256 pixel ($2^8$ by $2^8$) image will be less than a 251 by 251 pixel image even though the resulting image will have more pixels. Also, note, interferometric images are almost always square by convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the Fast Fourier Transform for the inversion between uv and image space the image has to be scaled to the correct size using the Similarity property of the FFT:\n",
    "$$V(au, av) \\rightleftharpoons \\frac{1}{|a|}I(\\frac{l}{a},\\frac{m}{a})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that we can scale the image to $-0.5N_x\\Delta\\theta_l \\leq l \\leq 0.5N_x\\Delta\\theta_l$ and $-0.5N_y\\Delta\\theta_m \\leq m \\leq 0.5N_y\\Delta\\theta_m$ by scaling with the uv tracks with the image size (in radians). This is in contrast to the approach taken when using the DFT: in the direct per pixel evaluation of the fourier sum the resolution can be specified directly."

If the resampling was done on data that was regularly sampled and the convolution function evaluated at these regular discrete steps then the function would just the ordinary discrete convolution.

Nevertheless we will use the regular convolution notation in our discussion.\n",

In gridding, as with traditional upsampling, the space in-between samples are filled with zero values. The only difference is that with gridding the original measurements are not regularly-spaced, as would be the case with upsampling. Just as with upsampling it is then necessary to assign values to these new zero values in-between the measured values. With gridding the values are smeared out over the grid points within a some area of support.\n",

Zero is convenient, but not the true value. We will come back to this point in the next chapter on [deconvolution &#10142;](6_Deconvolution/6_0_introduction.ipynb) which requires us to include additional knowledge to make an informed guess about what the value of these pixels could be. \n",

In degridding the opposite is done: the regularly sampled discerete values are convolved and sampled along the sampling tracks in the u,v plane. The convolution function smears (gridding) and gathers (degridding) the visibilities over / from some area of support before discretizing the visibilities to new coordinates. Ideally this function would be computed during the gridding and degridding operations, however, considering that the processing costs of gridding and degridding both scale as $MC_\\text{sup}^2$ these functions can be too computationally expensive to compute for every visibility and is normally pretabulated for a given support size. Additionally it is important to sample this function much more densely than the spacings between grid cells; interferometers take measurements in the spatial frequency domain and any large snapping / rounding operation on the coordinates of the samples will result in a decorrelation in the structural information about the image.

The Fourier transform of this box function is an infinite sinc function, which ripples out slowly towards infinity, and doesn't stop much of the aliasing effect.

To start off let's set up a uv tracks as would be seen by the JVLA in D configuration. Recall that image resolution is given by the longest track in u and v and that the baseline is always measured in wavelengths. You can play around with the nyquist rate and image sizes. Notice how subnyquist sampling adversely affect the angular resolution of your image."
