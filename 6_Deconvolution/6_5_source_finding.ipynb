    "## 6.5 Source Finding\n",
    "\n",
    "In radio astronomy, *source finding* is the process through which the attributes of radio sources -- such as flux density and mophorlogy -- are measured from data. In this section we will only cover source finding in the image plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source finding techniques usually involve four steps, i) charecterizing the noise (or background estimation), ii) thresholding the data based on knowledge of the noise, iii) finding regions in the thresholded image with \"similar\" neighbouring pixels (this is that same as *blob detection* in image processing), and iv) parameterizing these 'blobs' through a function (usually a 2D Gaussian). The source attributes are then estimated from the parameterization of the blobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5.1 Noise Charecterization\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, the radio data we process with source finders is noisy. To charecterize this noise we need to make a few assumptions about its nature, namely we assume that the niose results from some stochastic process and that it can be described by a normal distribution\n",

    "$$ G(x \\, | \\, \\mu,\\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\text{exp}\\left( \\frac{-(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$  \n",
    "where, $\\mu$ is the mean (or expected value) of the variable $x$, and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the distribution; $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation. Hence, the noise can be parameterized through the mean and the standard deviation. Let us illustrate this with an example. Bellow is a noise image from a MeerKAT simulation, along with a histogram of of the pixels (in log space)."

    "Now, in reality the noise has to measured in the presence of astrophysical emission. Furthermore, radio images are also contaminated by various instrumental effects which can manifest as spurious emission in the image domain. All these factors make it difficult to charercterize the noise in a synthesized image. Since the noise generally dominates the images, the mean and standard deviation of the entire image are still fairly good approximations of the noise. Let us now insert a few sources (image and flux distribution shown below) in the noise image from earlier and then try to estimate noise."

    "The pixel statistics of the image are no longer Gaussian as apparent from the long trail of the flux distribution. Constructing a Gaussian model from the mean and standard deviation results in a poor fit (blue line in the figure on the right). A better method to estimate the variance is to measure the dispersion of the data points about the mean (or median), this is the *mean/median absolute deviation* (MAD) technique. We will refer to the to median absolute deviation as the *MAD Median*, and the mean absolute deviation as the *MAD Mean*. A synthesis imaging specific method to estimate the variance of the noise is to only consider the negative pixels. This works under the assumption that all the astrophysical emission (at least in Stokes I) has a positive flux density. The Figure below shows noise estimates from methods mentioned above. "

Of course, more advanced functions could be used. Generally, we would like to group together near by pixels, such as spatially 'close' sky model components from deconvolution, into a single complex source.
