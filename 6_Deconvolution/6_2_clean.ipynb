    "If we carry on with the logic from the [previous section &#10142;](6_1_sky_models.ipynb) that we can use point sources as a generic unit for building sky models then we are ready to introduce the standard deconvolution method in radio interferometry, `CLEAN`. Deconvolution is a broad term, that is defined by different, discipline-specific techniques to separate out two functions which have previously been (approximately) convolved together. Such as in the case of the array point spread function and the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem of deconvolution seems fairly simple at first glance. We know how to convolve two functions $f$ and $g$ to produce an new function $h$ where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h = f \\circ g \\qquad.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given, $h$ and one of the other functions, say $g$ then $f$ can be deconvolved by using the convolution theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathscr{F}\\{f\\} = \\frac{\\mathscr{F}\\{h\\}}{\\mathscr{F}\\{g\\}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy, we have solved deconvolution, unfortunately this is only true for a *noise-less system*. And, as we will see in the [next chapter &#10142;](../7_Observing_Systems/7_0_introduction.ipynb), our interferometric observation definitely contains noise in the visibility measurements. When we are measuring the sky visibility function we are convolving the sky with the array response and some instrumental noise $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I^D = \\text{PSF} \\circ I_{true} + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If this $\\epsilon$ is small compared to the sky signal then we can approximate $\\epsilon$ as 0 and do this simple deconvolution method, which is called *inverse filtering*. Unfortunately, in radio astronomy, and most cases where deconvolution is required, $\\epsilon$ is not small. Applying an inverse filter to a noisy signal will result in a poor estimate of the original signal. As an example of why inverse filtering fails in synthesis imaging let us apply the method to the simple KAT-7 observation we have been using in previous sections. As this is simulated data we know the exact sky model and produce a dirty image which is free of any calibration issues, i.e. the observation is full known."

    "By applying a threshold to the dirty image (figure above on the left) we are effectively selecting out only signal so then we should be able to recover a sky model of at least the brightest sources. Unfortunately, we do not, as can be seen in the figure above on the right. Instead we see rings around the bright sources. This is because we are removing the PSF structure around the sources in the dirty image. When we apply the inverse PSF filter those missing sidelobes result in source edge effects, i.e. rings. Now, this is not terrible as we could go through the image detecting circles with a Hough transform and come up with a sky model of positions (but not necessarily flux). But, surely we could do something even better.\n",

    "First, we know the PSF response of the array. Second, we know that every source in the sky is convolved with (approximately) that PSF. We just need to find sources, which are not due to noise, and subtract the PSF multiplied by a factor (to account for different flux values) from that position in the image, and then add that position and flux multiplier to a sky model. Further, since each pixel contains some amount of noise or possible flux due to the PSF from some other source, we do not want to subtract all the flux in a single pixel in one go. Instead, we could iteratively subtract a portion of the flux in a pixel until some noise threshold is reached. This is called *iterative deconvolution*, a type of *greedy algorithm*, which is the basis what we call the class of `CLEAN` deconvoloution algorithms in synthesis imaging.\n",

Högbom's method is further discussed in the [next section &#10142;](6_3_clean_flavours.ipynb).
