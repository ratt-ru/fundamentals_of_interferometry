    "The field of radio astronomy is extremely broad with applications to many areas of science. However, when studying astronomical sources, it is important to have information at as large a frequency range as possible. Radio astronomy should therefore be combined with observations at other wavelengths (eg. infra-red, optical and x-ray) to fully investigate the nature of astronomical sources. Below we give an incomplete list of some sources that have been studied extensively in the radio band. "

    "The sun is the brightest radio object observed from earth. The radio emission from the sun can be divided into two parts: emission from the so-called \"quiet Sun\" and that from solar activities like coronal mass ejections.\n",
    "The emission from the \"quiet sun\" is a mixture of thermal and non-thermal emission. However, the strongest radio emission from the sun comes from coronal mass ejections and solar flares. The flux associated with these events can reach as high as $10^9$Jy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sun is observed in radio by radio interferometers such as the [Owens valley Solar Array](http://www.ovsa.njit.edu/) and the [Nancay Heliograph](http://secchirh.obspm.fr/nrh.php). Solar observations are also one of the key science projects of the [LOFAR array](http://www.lofar.org/astronomy/solar-ksp/solar-physics-and-space-weather). The upcoming SKA telescope will be able to study radio emission from the Sun with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. "

    "Radio galaxies are extra-galactic radio sources which are believed to be powered by supermassive black holes at their centres (most elliptical galaxies are believed to be of this kind). Radio emission may extend up to Mpc scales, many times larger than the optical extent of the galaxy. Synchroton emission is the dominant type of radio emission from these sources. The figure below shows the Fornax A radio galaxy. As can be seen from the figure, the visible (in optical) part of the galaxy is much smaller than the radio counterpart. "
