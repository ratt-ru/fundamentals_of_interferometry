    "All of us are familiar with the night sky. In fact, when we think of astronomy, the first picture that comes to mind is that of the star-strewn sky (with a few planets thrown in). People looking at less light-polluted skies are also able to make out details such as the milky band of our own galaxy. \n",

On one end is Gamma-ray astronomy, where individual photons have much larger energy than those in the visible range (and correspondingly much higher frequency) but far fewer numbers. On the other end is radio astronomy, where the photons are plentiful, but their individual energy is much smaller, with much smaller frequency than those in the visible range. \n",

    "The above image is an example of what are called composite images. These are images formed by combining two or more images, generally from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this example we have combined what we see in radio as well as optical frequencies. The object seen in the radio is Cygnus A, a radio galaxy (the closest such object to us). These are huge objects which are generated through the activity around a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy. The lobes we see in the figure (a form of plasma) are generated by jets of ionised particles which spew out in opposite directions and collide with the inter-galactic medium (IGM), resulting in the emission of radiation at radio frequencies. This is why we do not see the lobes in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. These objects affect the process of cosmological structure formation at various scales and are therefore of great relevance to our understanding of the Cosmos. "

    "Only in the radio image do the bridges between the three galaxies become clearly visible. They do not show up in optical because the gas contained within these bridges does not emit radiation at optical frequencies. The same thing happens for galactic rotation curves. Rotation curves plot the orbital velocity of *stuff* in a galaxy against the radial distance from its centre. They can be used to infer the amount of mass contained in the galaxy as a function of radius. Newtonian physics suggests that the velocity should fall off as $v \\propto r^{-1/2}$ as we move beyond the edge of the galaxy i.e. beyond most of the matter in the galaxy. Thus, if most of the matter in the galaxy consists of ordinary visible matter, the velocity should decrease beyond the optical disk. This is not what is observed in in practice indicating that not all the mass is enclosed within the visible disk. Indeed this was one of the first observations used to infer the presence of an unusual form of matter, called dark matter, which is not believed to interact with electromagnetic radiation. As a result dark matter is invisible (i.e. \"dark\") to us. Radio observations of the neutral hydrogen gas, which extends far beyond the visible extent of the galaxy, allow us to trace out rotation curves to much larger radii. Such data are useful when testing theories which attempt to explain the peculiar rotation curves typically observed in galaxies. The figure below (taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve)) illustrates the measurements through 'optical' (stars) and 'radio' (21 cm) measurements:"
