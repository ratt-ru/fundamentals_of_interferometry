This final section provides an overview of some of the interferometric arrays currently in use, the science goals of these projects, and future arrays in development.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the scale and cost of science in physics has grown there is a drive for international collaboration to pool  resources in order to build large, multi-purpose arrays. These arrays are meant to run as long term observatories with astronomers requesting time for a proposed projects. The prime example of this type of array is the future Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Another array type is an *ad-hoc* array such as in very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) where single dish telescopes (or beamformed arrays) from all over the world are combined (via a signal recorder) for an observation. The recorded signals are later sent to a correlator to create an interferometric observation. There are also experiment-driven arrays which are focused on a single experimental outcome with a limited lifetime. Many of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) arrays follow this model."

    "Stepping away from traditional dish-based interferometry we will take a look at the [Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR)&#10548;](http://www.lofar.org/) which was designed and build by the Dutch national astronomy research foundation ASTRON. This is a unique array as it is made up of stations instead of dish telescopes. Each station is made up of simple antenna elements and beamformed to act as a single telescope. These stations are called *aperture arrays*. They have the advantage of being 'electronically-steerable' which means that without any physical moving parts the aperture array can be 'pointed' in any direction in the sky. This is possible using the station digital electronics. This technique allows the aperture array to be pointed in multiple locations at the same time, something not possible with a dish optics system. LOFAR operates at a low frequency (< 250 MHz) compared to the arrays we have discussed so far. As such it has opened up a new region of the observable parameter space."

    "Moving beyond the purpose built arrays we have covered so far there are also interferometry networks. The idea behond a network is that multiple telescopes which normally operate in a single-dish observation mode can observe the same position in the sky and record the signals at the same time. These signals are then sent to a central location where they are correlated to produce visibilities. This *ad-hoc* network design is most widely used in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) which uses telescopes from all over the world to create a synthesized telescope on the scales of the Earth. VLBI can be used to perform the highest resolution astronomy such as measuring the size-scale of super-massive black holes at the centre of galaxies ([Event Horizon Telescope&#10548;](http://www.eventhorizontelescope.org/), [BlackHoleCam&#10548;](http://blackholecam.org/)).\n",

These telescopes are on different in different parts of the world, and though we may think of land and continents as being static, they are, of course, moving at rates of millimeters per year. These movements are taken into account with VLBI observations along with many other details. It is truly an engineering and scientific feat.\n",
