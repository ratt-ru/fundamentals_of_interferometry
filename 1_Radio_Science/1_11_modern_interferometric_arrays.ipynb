    "In the previous sections of this chapter we have covered the motivation for using interferometry to make measurements, the observable astrophysics and cosmology in the radio regime, and why interferometry is used in radio astronomy. This final section provides an overview of some of the interferometric arrays currently in use, the science goals of these projects, and future arrays in development.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the scale and cost of science in physics has grown, there is a drive for international collaboration to pool resources in order to build large, multi-purpose arrays. These arrays are meant to run as long term observatories, with astronomers requesting time for proposed projects. The prime example of this type of array is the future Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Another example is very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) where single dish telescopes (or beamformed arrays) from all over the world are combined (via a signal recorder) for an observation. The recorded signals are later sent to a correlator to create an interferometric observation. There are also experiment-driven arrays which are focused on a single experimental outcome with a limited lifetime. Many of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) arrays follow this model."

In the case of KAT-7 the maximum baseline length is 185 metres which, at 1.4 GHz, translates (via the Rayleigh criterion) to a resolution of 4.7 arcminutes. Interestingly, we can also think of the array as having a *minimum* resolution based on the minimum baseline length. Two elements can never be closer then their size, otherwise they would need to physically overlap. The effect of a minimum baseline, as we will see in later chapters, is that interferometric arrays are not sensitive to 'large-scale' structure (e.g. galactic synchrotron structures). A single element telescope, which is not limited by this minimum resolution effect, can be used to complement interferometric observations (see [<cite data-cite='2002ASPC..278..375S'>Short-Spacings Correction from the Single-Dish Perspective</cite> &#10548;](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ASPC..278..375S) for example).\n",

    "Stepping away from traditional dish-based interferometry we will take a look at the [Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR)&#10548;](http://www.lofar.org/) which was designed and build by the Dutch national astronomy research foundation ASTRON. This is a unique array as it is made up of stations instead of dish telescopes. Each station is made up of simple antenna elements and beamformed to act as a single telescope. These stations are called *aperture arrays*. They have the advantage of being 'electronically-steerable' which means that without any physical moving parts the aperture array can be 'pointed' in any direction in the sky. This is possible using the station's digital electronics. This technique allows the aperture array to be pointed in multiple locations at the same time, something which is not possible with traditional dish optics systems. LOFAR operates at a low frequency (< 250 MHz) compared to the arrays we have discussed so far. As such it has opened up a new region of the observable parameter space."

    "Moving beyond the purpose built arrays we have covered so far there are also interferometry networks. The idea behind a network is that multiple telescopes, which normally operate in a single-dish observation mode, can observe the same position in the sky and record the signals at the same time. These signals are then sent to a central location where they are correlated to produce visibilities. This *ad-hoc* network design is most widely used in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) which uses telescopes from all over the world to create a synthesized telescope on the scales of the Earth. In principle, VLBI can be used to perform the highest resolution astronomy. One very ambitious example is trying to determine the size-scale of super-massive black holes at the centre of galaxies ([Event Horizon Telescope&#10548;](http://www.eventhorizontelescope.org/), [BlackHoleCam&#10548;](http://blackholecam.org/)).\n",

We have written this introductory chapter to provide an overview of radio interferometry; where interferometry comes from, what science is done with interferometry, how radio interferometry works, and what some of the arrays currently being used look like. Over the remaining chapters we will focus on the fundamental aspects of interferometry covering [positional astronomy &#10142;](../3_Positional_Astronomy), [visibility space &#10142;](../4_Visibility_Space), [imaging &#10142;](../5_Imaging), [deconvolution &#10142;](../6_Deconvolution), [observing systems &#10142;](../7_Observing_Systems), [calibration &#10142;](../8_Calibration), and [practical &#10142;](../9_Practical) information for working with interferometric data. The [next chapter  &#10142;](../2_Mathematical_Groundwork) provides an overview of important mathematical concepts used throughout the book. This chapter should be used more as a reference, leading into the details of interferometry which begins in [Chapter 3 &#10142;](../3_Positional_Astronomy) with its foundations in positional astronomy."
