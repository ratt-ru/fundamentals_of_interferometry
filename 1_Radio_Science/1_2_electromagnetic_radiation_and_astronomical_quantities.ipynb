    "\n",
    "As astronomers we are interested in the light from celestial objects: we are interested in the electromagnetic waves these objects emit. Light is tricky because it behaves both as a wave (EM wave) and a particle (photon); this behaviour is best explored in a particle physics course. When it comes to radio astronomy, the light we observe is sufficiently low-energy that it is best treated as a wave rather than a particle; the wave-particle dichotomy will thus not be covered here, and we will treat light purely as a transverse wave in the EM field.\n",

    "\n",
    "These equations can be simplified by considering a region with no charges ($\\rho=0$) and no current ($J=0$). Let us do so, and take the curl (i.e. matrix product with $\\nabla$) of equations (3) and (4):\n",

    "This elegantly encodes the fact that the actual E-field oscillation associated with a given photon is varies in time and space, but that its *energy* is finite and constant in time and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have thus shown that the very nature of Maxwell's equations imply that electromagnetic waves must exist, a result reached by Maxwell himself. He also noted that the speed he predicted - based on measuring permittivity and permeability - was in perfect agreement with the value of the speed of light, which was already known due to an independent measurement by astronomer Ole Rømer! This was a strong indication - later vindicated in an experiment by Heinrich Hertz - that radio waves (and therefore light) were oscillations of an electric field.\n",

    "The final step to fully represent the signal our antennas monitor is to encode polarisation information into our EM wave. We will only briefly touch on the concepts required to provide a mathematical description of EM waves.\n",

    "Polarisation describes the situation where the frame of reference of an EM-wave (e.g. $E_x,E_y$) is rotated with respect to the frame of reference of your E-field ($E_{0x},E_{0y}$). This can occur when light travels through interstellar magnetic fields, such as ones found in ionised plasma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polarisation information is encoded in our final wave-function using **Jones calculus**. Although this is not the most general framework in which to treat polarisation it will suffice for our needs (for keen readers, Mueller calculus is an extension of Jones calculus which allows a more complete treatment of polarisation).\n",

    "The idea is basically to characterise the polarisation as phase shifts ($\\phi_0$ in Eq (15)) from the frame of reference of your E-field. In other words, the complex amplitude of E becomes: \n",

    "Astronomical observations are all about measuring the radiation from astronomical sources to infer the physical properties of these sources. Thus we start by discussing how measurements of radiation from astronomical sources gets quantified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The luminosity (typically denoted as $L$) of a source is the total energy emitted per unit time. This has units of Watts per second - or ergs per second if you prefer CGS units. This is the energy added over all the frequencies at which the source emits radiation (astronomical sources do not usually emit radiation at only a single frequency). This is also known as the 'bolometric luminosity'. More often, however, the luminosity of a source at a particular frequency is given. This is the 'spectral luminosity' of the source, denoted as $L_{\\nu}$ (*$\\nu$ will denote frequency, throughout the book*). The suffix is to remind us that :\n",
    "$$L = \\int L_{\\nu}\\, d\\nu $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral luminosity gets an extra $Hz^{-1}$ (Hertz) unit, since it is power (energy per unit time) at a given frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately it is not always possible to measure the true luminosity of a source since only a fraction of the total energy can be intercepted by a telescope. As a result we are forced to make certain assumptions about the nature of the radiation field (and indeed of the geometry of space-time itself). In particular we typically assume that the source is emitting isotropically. Furthermore, the amount of power received by the telescope (and hence the measured luminosity) depends on the size of its collecting surface. Since we do not want physics to depend on the apparatus used to study it, we ideally want to work with a quantity which is more independent of the means we use to measure it. For this reason the (spectral) power flux or flux density (sometimes flux is used synonymously) $S_\\nu$ is more appropriate.
