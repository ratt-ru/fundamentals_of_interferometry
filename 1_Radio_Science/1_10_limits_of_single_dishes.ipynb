    "In the [previous section &#10142;](1_9_a_brief_introduction_to_interferometry.ipynb) of this chapter we introduced the concepts and historical background of interferometry.  Earlier in the chapter we presented some of the basic astrophysical sources which emit in the radio spectrum. In this section we will try to answer why we need to use interferometry in radio astronomy. A related question we will try to answer is why we can not just use a single telescope as in traditional optical astronomy.\n",

    "Single telescopes are used in radio astronomy, and provide complimentary observational data to that of interferometric arrays. Astronomy with a single radio telescope is often called *single dish astronomy* as the telescope usually has a dish reflector (Figure 1.10.1). This dish is usually parabolic, but other shapes are also used, as it allows for the focusing of light to a single focal point where a receiver is placed - among other instruments this could be a camera in the optical, a bolometer in the far-infrared, or an antenna feed in the radio. Instead of a single dish telescope, a more general term would be a single *element* telescope which can be as simple as a dipole (Figure 1.10.2). An interferometric array (Figure 1.10.3) is used to create a *synthesized telescope* as it is considered a single telescope synthesized out of many elements (each element is also a telescope, it can get even more confusing)."

The larger the aperture the more collecting area, thus the more *sensitive* (a measure of how well the telescope is able to measure a signal) the telescope. This is the same as in photography.

    "There are certain physical limitations to account for when designing single dish radio telescopes. As an example consider that, due to its limited field of view and the rotation of the earth, an antenna will have to track a source on the sky to maintain a constant sensitivity. In principle this can be achieved by mounting the antenna on a pedestal and mechanically steering it with a suitable drive motors. However, in order to maintain the integrity of the antenna, the control systems for these drive motors need to be incredibly precise. Clearly, this gets harder as the size of the instrument increases and will constitute a critical design point on the engineering side. This is true in the optical case as well, but it is easier to manage since the telescopes are physically much smaller. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is an upper limit on how large we can build steerable single dish radio telescopes. This is because, just like everything else, the metals that these telescopes are made out of can only withstand finite amounts of stress and strain before deforming. Perhaps one of the greatest reminders of this fact came in 1988 with the [<cite data-cite='2008ASPC..395..323C'>collapse of the 300 foot Green Bank Telescope</cite> &#10548;](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ASPC..395..323C) (see **Figure 1.10.4**). Clearly, large steerable telescopes run the risk of collapsing under their own weight. The 100 meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) which replaced the 300 foot telescope is the largest steerable telescope in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger single dish apertures can still be reached though. Leaving the reflector fixed and allowing the receiver at the focus to move along the focal plane (or along the caustic) of the instrument, will mimic a slowly varying pointing in the sky (a so called steerable focus telescope). Indeed, this is how the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope (see **Figure 1.10.5**) operated. However, steerable focus telescopes come with limitations of their own (e.g. material cost and available space). In order to overcome these physical limitations and achieve a higher angular resolution we must use interferometric arrays to form a synthesized telescope."

A simple single dish telescope is made up of a primary reflector dish, mounted to point in some direction in the sky, and a signal receiver at the focal point of the reflector (Figure 1.3.6a). The receiver is typically an antenna in the case of radio astronomy or a camera in optical astronomy. \n",

Sources of astrophysical interest can be approximated as being infinitely far away as long as they are at distances much further away than the focal point of the lens.

Radio waves can be sufficiently sampled in time to digitally record the signals (this becomes more difficult at higher frequencies, and not possible in the near-infrared and higher).

So we can move each element to the ground and construct a pointing system for each sub-reflector (Figure 1.10.6d). We now have an array of smaller single dish telescopes!

    "This simple example hides much of the detail and we have yet to discuss the limitations of interferometric arrays and synthesized telescopes. But, for the moment, it is sufficient to think of interferometry as a method for overcoming the physical and engineering limitations inherent in building a single, massive telescope. This comes at the cost of additional digital hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introductory section we have highlighted why we need multi-element instruments. Since radio observations are done at a much longer wavelength (lower frequency) than those made in the visible, we would need much bigger radio telescopes to achieve the same angular resolution of optical telescopes. Employing an array of telescopes allows us to increase angular resolution and, by adding together the collecting areas of all the telescopes in the array, increase the sensitivity of the telescope. Because of the physical limitations involved in constructing very large single dish telescopes, it would be very difficult (and expensive) to achieve the same resolution and sensitivity with a single dish as can be achieved with an array of telescopes. However, as we will see, interferometry introduces a number of additional challenges.\n",
