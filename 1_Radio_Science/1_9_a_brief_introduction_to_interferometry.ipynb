    "### 1.9.1 The double-slit experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The basics of interferometry date back to Thomas Young's [double-slit experiment &#10142;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment) of 1801. In this experiment, a plate pierced by two parallel slits is illuminated by a monochromatic source of light. Due to the wave-like nature of light, the waves passing through the two slits *interfere*, resulting in an *interference pattern*, or *fringe*, projected onto a screen behind the slits:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/514px-Doubleslit.svg.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "**Figure 1.9.1:** *Schematic diagram of Young's double-slit experiment. Credit: Unknown.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The position on the screen $P$ determines the phase difference between the two arriving wavefronts. Waves arriving in phase interfere constructively and produce bright strips in the interference pattern. Waves arriving out of phase interfere destructively and result in dark strips in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll construct a toy model of a dual-slit experiment. Note that this model is not really physically accurate, it is literally just a \"toy\" to help us get some intuition for what's going on. A proper description of interfering electromagnetic waves will follow later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, a monochromatic electromagnetic wave of wavelength $\\lambda$ can be described at each point in time and space as a complex quantity i.e. having an amplitude $A$, and a phase $\\phi$, such that $A\\mathrm{e}^{\\imath\\phi}$. For simplicity, let us assume a constant amplitude $A$, but allow the phase to vary as a function of time and position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if the same wave travels along two paths of different lengths and recombines at a point $P$, the resulting electric field is a sum of the two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E=E_1+E_2 = A\\mathrm{e}^{\\imath\\phi}+A\\mathrm{e}^{\\imath(\\phi-\\phi_0)},$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the phase delay $\\phi_0$ corresponds to the path length difference $\\tau_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\phi_0 = 2\\pi\\tau_0/\\lambda.$\n",
    "\n",
    "What is actually \"measured\" on the screen, the ***brightness***, is, physically, a time-averaged electric field intensity $EE^*$, where the $^*$ represents complex conjugation (this is exactly what our eyes, or a photographic plate, or a detector in the camera perceive as \"brightness\"). We can work this out as\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "EE^* = (E_1+E_2)(E_1+E_2)^* = E_1 E_1^* + E_2 E_2^* + E_1 E_2^* + E_2 E_1^* = A^2 + A^2 \n",

    "2A^2 + 2A^2 \\cos{\\phi_0}.\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the phase term, $\\phi$, has dropped out, and the only thing that's left is the phase delay $\\phi_0$. The first part of the sum is constant, while the second part, the ***interfering term***, varies with phase difference $\\phi_0$, which in turn depends on position on the screen $P$. It is easy to see that the resulting intensity $EE^*$ is a purely real quantity that varies from 0 to $4A^2$. This is exactly what produces the alternating bright and dark stripes on the screen.\n"

    "If you were given the job of constructing an interferometer for astronomical measurements, you would quickly find that the double-slit experiment does not translate into a very practical design. The baseline needs to be quite large; a box with slits and a screen is physically unwieldy. A more viable design can be obtained by playing with the optical path.\n",

    "The basic design still used in optical interferometry to this day is the *Michelson stellar interferometer* mentioned above. This is schematically laid out as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "The outer set of mirrors plays the role of slits, and provides a baseline of length $d$, while the rest of the optical path serves to bring the two wavefronts together onto a common screen. The first such interferometer, used to carry out the Betelgeuse size measurement, looked like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "In modern optical interferometers using the Michelson layout, the role of the \"outer\" mirrors is played by optical telescopes in their own right. For example, the Very Large Telescope operated by ESO can operate as an interferometer, combining four 8.2m and four 1.8m individual telescopes:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the radio regime, the physics allow for more straightforward designs. The first radio interferometric experiment was the sea-cliff interferometer developed in Australia during 1945-48. This used reflection off the surface of the sea to provide a \"virtual\" baseline, with a single antenna measuring the superimposed signal:\n",

    "In a modern radio interferometer, the \"slits\" are replaced by radio dishes (or collections of antennas called *aperture arrays*) which sample and digitize the incoming wavefront. The part of the signal path between the \"slits\" and the \"screen\" is then completely replaced by electronics. The digitized signals are combined in a *correlator*, which computes the corresponding complex visibilities. We will study the details of this process in further lectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the delicate optical path of an optical interferometer, digitized signals have the advantage of being endlessly and losslessly replicable. This has allowed us to construct entire interferometric *arrays*. An example is the the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA, New Mexico, US) consisting of 27 dishes:\n",

    "### 1.9.6 Aperture synthesis vs. targeted experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Interferometry was born as a way of conducting specific, targeted, and rather exotic experiments. The 1920 Betelgeuse size measurement is a typical example. In contrast to a classical optical telescope, which could directly obtain an image of the sky containing information on hundreds to thousands of objects, an interferometer was a very delicate apparatus for indirectly measuring a single physical quantity (the size of the star in this case). The spatial resolution of that single measurement far exceeded anything available to a conventional telescope, but in the end it was always a specific, one-off measurement. The first interferometers were not capable of directly imaging the sky at that improved resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In radio interferometry, all this changed in the late 1960s with the development of the *aperture synthesis* technique by Sir Martin Ryle's group in Cambridge. The crux of this technique lies in combining the information from multiple baselines. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this point, consider the following. As you saw from playing with the toy double-slit simulator above, for each baseline length, the interference pattern conveys a particular piece of information about the sky. For example, the following three \"skies\" yield exactly the same interference pattern on a particular baseline, so a single measurement would be unable to distinguish between them:"

This is because each baseline essentially measures one *Fourier component* of the sky brightness distribution (Chapter 4 will explain this in more detail); and once we know the Fourier components, we can compute a Fourier transform in order to recover the sky image. The advent of sufficiently powerful computers in the late 1960s made this technique practical, and turned radio interferometers from exotic contraptions into generic imaging instruments. With a few notable exceptions, modern radio interferometry ***is*** aperture synthesis.\n",
