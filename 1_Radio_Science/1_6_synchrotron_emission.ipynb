Since, in an (approximately) uniform magnetic field, the synchrotron emission depends only on the magnetic field and the energy of the particle, all we need is the number distribution of the particles. Denoting the number distribution function of the particles as $N(E)$ (i.e. the number of particles at energy $E$ per unit volume per solid angle), and the  probability of a particle having energy $E$ as $P(E)$, the spectrum resulting from an ensemble of particles is: \n",
