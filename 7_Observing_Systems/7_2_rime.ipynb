For K-Jones, this is clearly not necessarily true -- the $uvw$ coordinate vector changes over time due to the Earth's rotation, and the frequency dependence is explicit in the $1/\\lambda$ scaling of the exponent. This results in the phase term $K_{pq}=K_p K_q^H$ being a complex quantity with a rotating complex phase, and **averaging a rotating complex phase (i.e. a *vector average*!) always reduces amplitude**. In interferometry, this effect is known as time/frequency ***smearing***.

The Jones form of the RIME yields itself more naturally to discussions on calibration, since it emphasizes the per-antenna nature of propagation effects.\n",
