    "#### 7.2.2.3. Effects of averaging & fringe stopping\n",
    "In deriving the RIME, we assumed that Jones matrices are constant over the chosen time - and frequency - averaging intervals. For K-Jones, this is clearly not necessarily true -- the $uvw$ coordinate vector changes over time due to the Earth's rotation, and the frequency dependence is explicit in the $1/\\lambda$ scaling of the exponent. This results in the phase term $K_{pq}=K_p K_q^H$ being a complex quantity with a rotating complex phase, and **averaging a rotating complex phase (i.e. a *vector average*!) always reduces amplitude**. In interferometry, this effect is known as time/frequency ***smearing***. In exteme cases, if the phase rotates through a cycle or more over the averaging interval, the vector average will be close to 0!\n",

    "Fortunately, we can mimimize the effect of smearing in a particular direction of interest. Consider again the coordinates figure above -- for a wavefront arriving from direction $S_0$ (our directon of interest), the direction vector is $\\mathbf{\\sigma}_0 = (0,0,1)$, and the corresponding phase term is\n",

    "\n",
    "This phase term corresponds to the excess pathlength $\\tau_0$ (see the figure above) associated with baseline $pq$ and direction $S_0$. Since $w_{pq}$ can change as a function of time, averaging over this complex exponent will lead to smearing (i.e. amplitude loss). This can be avoided by having the correlator insert an artificial delay of $-\\tau_0$ into its signal chain. The effective K-Jones towards direction $\\sigma$ is then given by\n",

This technique is known as ***fringe stopping***, since we are effectively \"stopping\" the complex fringe in the direction $\\sigma_0$ from rotating as a function of frequency and time. The effect of fringe stopping is to minimize both the phase and the resulting phase variations of $K_{pq}$ around the reference direction $S_0$. This is the case here, since $l,m,n-1$ are all small numbers for $S$ close to $S_0$.\n",

    "### 7.2.3. The all-sky RIME\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider again the [basic RIME of a point source &#10549;](#instrum:sec:rime:point_source). The real sky does not contain a single point source, but must rather be described with a brightness distribution. We can express this by making $\\mathbf{B}$ a function of direction: $\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{\\sigma})$. The signal path from each direction is also different in principle: the Jones matrix should thus also be a function of direction, $\\mathbf{J}_p(\\mathbf{\\sigma})$. Again assuming a linear system, the aggregate correlation $\\mathbf{V}_{pq}$ recorded by our interferometer can be obtained by integrating the RIME over the entire celestial spehere:\n",

    "\n",
    "To make this integral a little more tractable, let us change variables to $l,m$. This is equivalent to projecting (half of) the celestial spehere onto a plane tangential at $S_0$. We can safely assume that the other half of the sphere is not visible to our instrument: the Earth is in the way...there are a few exotic exceptions to this e.g. space interferometry, but it is generally true. We have:\n",

    "Let us now split $\\mathbf{J}_p$ into direction-dependent and direction-independent parts. Recall that $\\mathbf{J}_p$ is a product of a [Jones chain ($\\S$7.1 &#10142; )](7_1_jones_notation.ipynb#instrum:sec:jones:chains) of Jones matrices representing successive propagation effects:\n",
