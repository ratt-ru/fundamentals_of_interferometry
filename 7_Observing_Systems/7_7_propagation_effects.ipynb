The delay due to a non-unity refractive index ($n$) is $$\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{c} \\int (n - 1) dy, $$ where c is the speed of light and the refractive path length is the geodesic (i.e. here, a straight line). The refractivity of moist air is described by the empirical formula $$N = 77.6\\frac{p_D}{T} + 64.8\\frac{p_V}{T} + 3.776 \\times 10^5 \\frac{p_V}{T^2}, $$ where the refractivity is $N \\equiv 10^6(n-1)$, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvins, and $p_D$ and $p_V$ are the partial pressures of dry air and water vapor respectively. Since the atmosphere obeys the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium (to a good approximation), it is clear that to zeroth order, the trosphere's refractive index will have some dependence on time-of-day, time-of-season, site altitude and latitude. Note that water vapour is not well mixed in the atmosphere, and is therefore not well correlated with ground-based meteorological parameters."

There are a series of strong water vapour lines between 100 GHz to 1 THz.
