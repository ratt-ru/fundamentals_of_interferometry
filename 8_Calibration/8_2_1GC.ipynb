    "The preceding chapters of this course have hopefully made it clear that an interferometer does not perform error-free measurements. On the contrary, an interferomter's measurements will be corrupted by a variety of effects. These include environmental effects such as the atmosphere, as well as faults and inaccuracies in the system itself. Naturally, doing good science requires good data. This is the purpose of calibration - given a signal which has been corrupted in a variety of ways, we can restore it to something resembling the truth.\n",

This is done so that the calibrator observations track changes in the observational parameters. Thus, it is possible to solve for calibrator gain solutions which can then be transeferred to the target field. This is usually an effective method of removing large-scale errors in the visibilities. The requirements placed on calibrator sources vary based on which quantity is being calibrated. \n",

The number of calibrator sources which satisfy these conditions is low; they are often very far away from the target.<br><br>\n",

This is often done before bandpass calibration, as it can be fit once to all the data. This is usually performed using the same calibrator source as the bandpass calibration.<br><br>\n",
    "&bull; Gain calibration is used to determine the complex valued gains. This is done regularly throughout the observation. The calibrator source needs to be relatively bright but, more importantly, it needs to be close to the target. This is because the gain calibrator is used to track the evolution of local effects, such as the atmosphere. As such, the closer the calibrator is to the target, the more likely it is to be subject to the same effects. \n",

    "One point has been neglected in the above discussion: how do we actually calibrate using the calbrator observations? The answer is, fortunately, relatively simple. As you have seen in [Sec. 8.1 &#10142;](../8_Calibration/8_1_Calibration_Least_Squares_Problem.ipynb#pos:sec:lst)<!--\\ref{pos:sec:lst}-->, it is possible to treat calibration as a least-squares problem. 1GC is no exception. One helpful fact is that the model will usually contain only a single source. For a point source at the centre of the field, the model reduces to simply the amplitude of the calibrator multiplied by the antenna gains. For more complicated calibrator sources, this will not be the case. However, given a sufficiently accurate source model, complcated calibrators can still be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the calibrator solutions have been found, the final obstacle is transferring the solution to the target field. In the simplest case, this can be done by applying the results from a calibrator observation to the subsequent target field observation/s. It is also possible to do more complicated solution transfers by interpolating between values or fitting curves across the solutions."
