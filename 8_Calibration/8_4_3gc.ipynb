    "As explained in [Chapter 7 &#10142;](../7_Observing_Systems/7_0_introduction.ipynb), the increased field-of-view of modern telescopes causes direction-dependent effects, such as the primary beam and pointing error, to become apparent. Therefore, we cannot rely on using direction-independent self-calibration (see [$\\S$ 8.3 &#10142;](../8_Calibration/8_3_2gc.ipynb)). There are, in principle, many approaches one can use to perform direction-dependent calibration (see [$\\S$ 8.4.1 &#10549;](#cal:sec:p_versus_h) for more details).\n",

    "This equation is known as the all-sky RIME, where $\\mathbf{V}_{pq}$ is the $2\\times2$ correlation matrix measured by the interferometer and $\\mathbf{X}_{pq}$ is the $2\\times2$ coherency matrix.

During calibration we estimate $\\mathbf{G}_p$ and $\\mathbf{G}_q$ which we subsequently use to correct the correlation matrix $\\mathbf{V}_{pq}$. The subscripts $p$ and $q$ denote the antennas that were used to make the measurement. Furthermore, $\\mathbf{X}_{pq} = \\sum_s \\mathbf{X}_{spq}$ where $s$ is the source index, i.e. in the all-sky RIME we assume that the error that corrupts our visibilities is independent of the sources' positions.

However, if we do not have any information about the physical source that is responsible for a direction dependent effect then we could use the idea of differential gains instead.
