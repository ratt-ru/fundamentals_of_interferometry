A double loop to compute all elements of the Fourier-transformed spectrum, and a matrix multiplication by generating the Fourier kernel $K$. The compute time to perform the DFT is $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, this is it takes $cN^2$ operations where $c > 1$ is a constant factor. Though as note in [$\\S$ 2.8.5 &#10142;](2_8_the_discrete_fourier_transform.ipynb) the matrix implementation is much fast that the loop because this algorithm takes advantage of fast vector math libraries.\n",
