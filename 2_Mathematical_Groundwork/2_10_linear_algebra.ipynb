    "The pdf allows us to assign a likelihood to any specific realisation of $\\epsilon$. Clearly, since the quantity in the exponent is non-negative, the likelihood increases as $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$. Thus, if $\\bf{A}$ and ${\\bf b}$ are fixed, we can use the pdf to find the most likely value of ${\\bf x}$ which we denote ${\\bf \\bar{x}}$. Doing so is actually surprisingly simple, well at least when the system is of full rank. First note that the position of the maximum in the likelihood does not change on taking the log of the pdf, a fact which comes in handy in numerical applications. The negative log likelihood of the Gaussian pdf is called the $\\chi^2$ distribution and it takes the following form\n",

This allows us to use numerical minimisation schemes (of which you will hear more of in the next section [2.11 Least-squares Minimization &#10142;](2_11_least_squares.ipynb)) to find ${\\bf \\bar{x}}$. Actually, when the system is of full rank, there is a simpler analytic way to find ${\\bf \\bar{x}}$. This is because a Gaussian pdf has only a single stationary point. You should remember (from first year calculus) how to find this stationary point i.e. take the derivative and set it to zero. The only (hopefully) slightly tricky part is taking the gradient of $\\chi^2$ w.r.t. ${\\bf x}$ (i.e. finding the Jacobian). The expression for the Jacobian is\n",

    "$$ \\partial_x \\chi^2 = \\mathbb{J} = {\\bf A}^H {\\bf W} ({\\bf b} - {\\bf Ax}). $$\n",

    "This is very useful since many different problems can be written in linear form. Note that when the Hessian matrix $\\mathbb{H} = {{\\bf A}^H{\\bf W A}}$ is singular (as is the case in interferometric imaging), or we are looking to the solution to a non-linear system (as is the case in interferometric calibration) we have to resort to approximate and/or iterative methods. Iterative minimisation techniques are discussed in the next section [2.11 Least-squares Minimization &#10142;](2_11_least_squares.ipynb). Next we demonstrate the above by doing a familiar example viz. fitting a straight line to data.   "
