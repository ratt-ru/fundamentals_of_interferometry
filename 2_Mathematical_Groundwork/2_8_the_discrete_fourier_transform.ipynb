    "In such cases the discrete equivalent of the Fourier transform, called the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), is very useful. In fact, where the scale of the problem necessitates using a computer to perform calculations, the Fourier transform can only be implemented as the discrete equivalent. There are some subtleties we should be aware of when implementing the DFT. These mainly arise because it is very difficult to capture the full information present in a continuous signal with a finite number of samples. In this chapter we review the DFT and extend some of the most useful identities derived in the previous sections to the case where we only have acces to a finite number of samples. The subtleties that arise due to limited sampling will be discussed in the next section."

Looking at the definition of the discrete Fourier transform [discrete Fourier transform &#10549;](#math:eq:8_001)<!--\\ref{math:eq:8_001}-->, one can see that, under certain circumstances, the same summands occur multiple times. Recall that the DFT is periodic i.e. $Y_k = Y_{N+k}$, where $N$ is the number of data points. Now suppose that $N = 8$. In calculating the component $Y_2$ we would have to compute the quantity $y_2\\,e^{-2{\\pi}\\imath\\frac{2 \\cdot 2}{8}}$ i.e. when $n = 2$. However, using the periodicity of the kernel $e^{-2\\pi\\imath \\frac{kn}{N}} = e^{-2\\pi\\imath \\frac{k(n+N)}{N}}$, we can see that this same quantity will also have to be computed when calculating the component $Y_6$ since $y_2\\,e^{-2{\\pi}\\imath\\frac{2\\cdot2}{8}}=y_2e^{-2{\\pi}\\imath\\frac{6\\cdot2}{8}} = y_2e^{-2{\\pi}\\imath\\frac{12}{8}}$.

Importantly the form of the kernel (i.e. $e^{-2\\pi\\imath \\frac{km}{N/2}}$) looks the same for both the odd and the even $n$ indices. Now, while $k$ is in the range $0, \\cdots , N-1$, $n$ only ranges through $0,\\cdots,N/2 - 1$. The DFT written in the above form will therefore be periodic with period $N/2$ and we can exploit this periodic property to compute the DFT with half the number of computations.

    "And voila! We can compute the DFT with one quarter the usual number of operations effectively reducing the computational cost to $\\mathcal{O}(N/4)$. This idea was introduced by Cooley und Tukey in 1965 when they published \"The Fast Fourier Transform\" algorithm. Their algorithm actually splits each smaller DFT up even further, until the arrays are small enough so that the strategy is no longer beneficial. The Cooley and Tukey algorithm has a computational complexity which scales as $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log_2N)$. An example of a recursive Python implementation (as well as a vectorised one) using their idea can be found here https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/08/28/understanding-the-fft/. The FFT algorithm made it possible to, for the first time, compute the Fourier transform of very large data sets. The FFT is used in so many real life applications that is is probably safe to say it is the single most useful algorithm ever invented.  \n",

    "Today's implementations of DFTs make use of many other clever tricks for further optimisation. So much work has gone into efficiently implememting the DFT that it is impossible to descibe every aspect here. Often we can simply use these algorithms as a black-box without really needing to know what is going on behind the scenes. As we will see in the coming chapters, there are at least some details which we should be aware of. For example, in the above implementation the number of data points has to be a power of two to make full use of the computational speed up provided by the FFT. One aspect that we have conveniently left out is the implicit assumption that the data points are spaced equally far apart in time (or frequency). Although this is not really necessary for the definition of the DFT, it does make things a lot simpler. This is one of the crucial requirements of the FFT however and we will see it creep up again later. "
