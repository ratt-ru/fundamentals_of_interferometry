    "\n",
    "A propagating wave is said to have *temporal coherence* if the phase difference between any two points, at an instant of time, along the direction of propagation (e.g. $P_1$ and $P'_1$ on Fig. [4.3.3a &#10549;](#fig:423)) is independent of time. In other words, a wave is temporally coherent if successive wavefronts are propagating between the two points with the same delay. Temporal coherence tells us how monochromatic a source is.\n",

    "Similarly, a propagating wave has *spatial coherence* if the phase difference, between any two points in a plane perpendicular to the direction propagation and at an instant of time, (here $P_2$ and $P'_2$ on Fig. [4.3.3 &#10549;](#fig:423)) is independent of time. In other words, a wave is spatially coherent if the spatial shape of the wavefront remains the same as the wave propagates. \n",

Conversely, the red lines show phases are no longer time-independent.\n",
    "\n",
