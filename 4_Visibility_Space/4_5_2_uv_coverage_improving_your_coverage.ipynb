    "In an ideal case, this plane is equivalent to the visibility function, which what we **want** to measure. The $uv$-coverage of an observation tells us which parts of the visibility function has been sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [$\\S$ 4.5.1 &#10142;](4_5_1_uv_coverage_uv_tracks.ipynb), we showed that sampling the $uv$-plane with a single baseline amounts to sampling along an elliptical track due to the rotation of the Earth. The track's parameters can be predicted if we know the location of the interferometer on Earth, the direction of the source and the baseline characteristics. The $uv$-track is thus the set of spatial frequencies (i.e.$uv$ points) which a single baseline will sample over the course of an observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [$\\S$ 4.5.2 &#10549;](4_5_2_uv_coverage_improving_your_coverage.ipynb), we discussed three different ways of improving your $uv$ coverage. Firstly, we can increase the number of antennas and alter their distribution: this improves the *instantaneous* spatial coverage. Second, we can use the fact that the observed source is moving with the Celestial Sphere (i.e. the Earth spins). The continuous variation of the projected baseline - and therefore its $u,v$-coordinates - allow us to sample portions of elliptical $uv$ tracks. \n",
    "\n",
    "A long integration time allows astronomers to easily improve their $uv$-plane coverage at little cost. Note that maximising using this technique to improve $uv$-coverage will require taking more measurements in time, thus increasing computational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, by using broadband receivers, we can sample the visibilities at various frequencies and compute the cross-correlations in different frequency channels. By doing so, the $uv$-coverage is improved along radial $uv$ tracks.\n",
    "Of course, these methods cannot extend our $uv$-coverage arbitrarily. They are limited by both the instrument sensitivity and the instrument's point source response (see [$\\S$ 9.3 &#10142;](../9_Practical/9_3_Observing_smearing.ipynb)).\n",
