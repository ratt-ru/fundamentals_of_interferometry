Later in the chapter we will discuss the [$\\S$ 4.6 &#10142;](4_6_the_fourier_approximation_van_cittert_zernike_theorem.ipynb) which allows us to construct an image of the sky from an approximate 2-D Fourier transform between the baseline visibility sampling and the sky. There are many caveats to this theorem, which will be discussed in good time. For now, the important thing to understand is: for a given point on the celestial sphere, the 3-D baselines can be projected onto a 2-D plane, and as the Earth rotates (and the Celestial sphere stays fixed), this changes the projection of each baseline. This change in projection is key to the practice of radio interferometric observation, and will come up again when we discuss [$\\S$ 4.5.1 &#10142;](4_5_1_uv_coverage_uv_tracks.ipynb)."
