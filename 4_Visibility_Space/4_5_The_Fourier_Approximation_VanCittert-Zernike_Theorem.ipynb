In order to make these signals \"interfere\", we need to devise a system to combine them in phase. We introduced the concept of *baseline*, *projected baseline* and *phase center*. \n",

In [$\\S$ 4.2 &#10142;](4_2_The_2-element_Interferometer.ipynb), we studied the simple case of the 2-element interferometer for which we derived the relevant interferometric quantities (*phase center*, *coherence*, *visibility*).\n",

To give a physical interpretation on how relevant is the visibility function to study object in the sky, we linked the projected baseline measurement to the result of a spatial filter applied to the sky. Using this information, we demonstrate how the shape and the position of a source could be accurately measured by interferometry ($\\S$ 4.3.2).\n",

They take the form of elliptical path which can potentially enrich the $uv$ plane. The more diversified and numerous are the samples in the $uv$ plane, the better the knowledge of the visibility function. In order to improves the $uv$ coverage, we presented in [$\\S$ 4.4.2 &#10142;](4_4_2_UV_Coverage_Improving_Your_Coverage.ipynb) three different ways that increase the number of samples.\n",
